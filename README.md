# Code-Quiz

This coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions,interactive challenges, and feedback responses. This app adapts to multiple screen sizes, presents the user with a timed multiple choice test, and saves the score to local storage.

## Improvements

```
The user cannot se score unless they open up the applications tab in the chrome developer tools. Also, the code needs to be refactored since it is not 'dry'

```
